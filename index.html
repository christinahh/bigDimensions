    <div class="sectionInfo" id="briggsInfo">The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) assessment is one of the world’s most popular personality tools. Using Carl Jung’s theory of psychological types, Isabel Briggs Myers and Katharine Briggs created the instrument to determine preferences between four dichotomies: Introversion/Extraversion, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling and Judging/Perceiving. The 16 combinations of preferences make up the 16 personality types.</div>
